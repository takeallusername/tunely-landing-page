                    <p>

                        of your intention to cancel within the 14-day period. For immediate processing, contact our

                    <h4>Cancellation Form</h4>
                    <p style="padding-left: var(--space-lg); font-style: italic; color: var(--text-tertiary);">
                        To: Tunely Support Team<br>
                        I hereby give notice that I cancel my contract for the sale of the following product:<br>

                    <p>
                        If you cancel this agreement, we will reimburse all payments received from you.

                    <h3>3.5 Exception to Right to Cancel</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>For Digital Content:</strong> Your right to cancel as a consumer does not apply to
                        digital content
                        that has started to be delivered, downloaded, or otherwise acquired. If you start creating an
                        app or begin using
                        the service, you consent to immediate performance and will lose your right to cancel this
                        agreement.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.6 Subscription Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>
                        You can cancel subscriptions at any time, but no refunds will be provided for the unused portion
                        of the current
                        subscription period that has already been paid. Upon cancellation, you may continue to use the
                        service until
                        the end of the current billing period. To cancel your subscription, contact our support team at
                        least 48 hours
                        before the end of the current billing period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For subscriptions offering a free trial, if you decide to cancel before charges begin, you must
                        cancel
                        before the trial period expires.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.7 Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Refunds are provided on a case-by-case basis at Paddle's discretion. Refund requests may be
                        denied if
                        evidence of fraud, refund abuse, or other manipulative behavior is found.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This policy does not affect consumer rights regarding products that are not as described,
                        defective,
                        or not fit for purpose.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.8 Wire Transfer Payments</h3>
                    <p>
                        For wire transfer payments, you must provide accurate payment details (unique bank transfer
                        reference number),
                        company VAT/sales tax code, and order information. Wire transfer payments are not protected
                        under the Consumer
                        Credit Act (CCA) and are not eligible for refunds. However, for transactions including sales tax
                        where the
                        total amount is above $100 / £100 / €100, refunds may be available at Paddle's discretion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3.9 Indirect Sales Tax Refund Policy</h3>
                    <p>
                        If sales tax was charged on your purchase and you are registered for sales tax in the country of
                        purchase,
                        you may be entitled to a refund of the sales tax amount if permitted by the laws of that
                        country.
                        Sales taxes include VAT, GST, Consumption Tax, and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To receive a sales tax refund, you must contact Tunely within 60 days of completing the
                        purchase.
                        Refunds will only be processed upon providing a valid sales tax code for your country.
                        All refund requests received after 60 days from the transaction date will not be processed.
